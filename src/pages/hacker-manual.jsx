          <h4 className="text-l mt-4 font-bold">Track Awards</h4>
          <div>
            The track awards are centered around themes that align with our{" "}
            <a href="/manifesto">manifesto</a>, and what we believe the industry
            needs to re-focus on. The winning teams of the track awards receive{" "}
            <strong>7,000 DAI</strong>.

          <ul className="mt-2">
            <li>
              <b>Defensive Tooling:</b> This track is the right choice for you
              if you want to hack on tools that enhance security and privacy.
              It's about building projects that prioritize defense,
              decentralization, and resilience to create a more secure and freer
              world.
              <br />
              Think topics like encryption, counter-surveillance, identity
              protection, anonymity, anti-identity, security, local data
              handling, and anything that armors the individual against
              intrusive data collection practices.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Freedom to Transact:</b> This track is for you if you want to
              ensure that anyone, anywhere, anytime can facilitate unrestricted
              transactions.
              <br />
              We're looking for projects that enable people to access and send
              money, or value, across borders without restrictions, promoting
              financial inclusion. This track is for those who want to hack on
              peer-to-peer solutions, build censorship-resistant applications,
              and ensure that transactions can be private and secure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Social Technologies:</b> This track is all about platforms and
              tools that enable informed and collective decision-making,
              transparent governance, and collaboration and coordination among
              decentralized communities.
              <br />
              If you want to build credibly neutral systems for voting,
              governance, and social interaction, and systems that counter
              disproportionate influence of centralized powers then this track
              is for you and your team. Other ideas you could hack on are
              consensus-finding algorithms, sybil resistance, and decentralized
              social reputation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Infrastructure:</b> The backbone of the revolution. This track
              is dedicated to the architects and builders laying down the
              underlying infrastructures that robust distributed public goods
              need to run efficiently and reliably.
              <br />
              Projects could include protocol specification and implementations,
              networking, developer tools, and hardware.

            As with all previous ETHBerlins we've made sure to have a team of
            amazing mentors ready to help you build the best possible projects
            throughout the weekend. No questions are too small or too big to
            ask. As a hacker you can find the mentors in person as per the TL;DR
            above. You can also contact them with any questions you might have
            in the Matrix room that's also listed in the TL;DR. If you ask the
            question in the middle of the night you might not get a reply right
            away, but we will make sure to address it first thing in the
            morning.
          </p>
          <p>
            We encourage hackers to help each other out and keep an eye on the
            mentoring matrix channel. There might be some hackers with very
            specific expert knowledge and it would be great if this could be
            shared.
          </p>
          <p>
            You might also see the mentors throughout the venue. They'll be
            wearing a button/badge on their shirt saying "Mentor". They're all
            very friendly so don't hesitate to ask them a question or get their
            feedback on something.

              This year thanks to our amazing Kirill, we've built our own tool
              for submissions and judging. The tool is open source, simple to
              use and should make the job of judging and tallying scores simple
              and fast.
