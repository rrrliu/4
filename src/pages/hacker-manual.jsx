              We're looking for projects that enable people to access and send
              money, or value, across borders without restrictions, promoting
              financial inclusion. This track is for those who want to hack on
              peer-to-peer solutions, build censorship-resistant applications,
              and ensure that transactions can be private and secure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Social Technologies:</b> This track is all about platforms and
              tools that enable informed and collective decision-making,
              transparent governance, and collaboration and coordination among
              decentralized communities.
              <br />
              If you want to build credibly neutral systems for voting,
              governance, and social interaction, and systems that counter
              disproportionate influence of centralized powers then this track
              is for you and your team. Other ideas you could hack on are
              consensus-finding algorithms, sybil resistance, and decentralized
              social reputation.

              <b>Infrastructure:</b> The backbone of the revolution. This track
              is dedicated to the architects and builders laying down the
              underlying infrastructures that robust distributed public goods
              need to run efficiently and reliably.
              <br />
              Projects could include protocol specification and implementations,
              networking, developer tools, and hardware.

            projects. So for this one we invite you to go meta by building
            contributions that improve the ETHBerlin experience itself! Projects
            eligible for this award can either pick from our wishlist{" "}
            <i>(coming soon™)</i> of contributions, or can build an entirely new
            thing that they consider to be a positive impact for future versions

            As with all previous ETHBerlins we've made sure to have a team of
            amazing mentors ready to help you build the best possible projects
            throughout the weekend. No questions are too small or too big to
            ask. As a hacker you can find the mentors in person as per the TL;DR
            above. You can also contact them with any questions you might have
            in the Matrix room that's also listed in the TL;DR. If you ask the
            question in the middle of the night you might not get a reply right
            away, but we will make sure to address it first thing in the
            morning.
          </p>
          <p>
            We encourage hackers to help each other out and keep an eye on the
            mentoring matrix channel. There might be some hackers with very
            specific expert knowledge and it would be great if this could be
            shared.
          </p>
          <p>
            You might also see the mentors througout the venue. They'll be
            wearing a button/badge on their shirt saying "Mentor". They're all
            very friendly so don't hesitate to ask them a question or get their
            feedback on something.
